	  <p>Treasure Games was founded on July 2, 2007 by a group of friends. The group had decided to make a business of selling vintage 
	  video games for the best prices they could find when they themselves had to pay the outrageous prices for old games. Their mission become to provide
	   the best experience possible at their store while also still providing the best prices.</p>
	   
	   <p>As they went along with the process of starting a business, they ran into various obstacles as many new business owners do. They ran into obstacles 
	   such as finding their first building, finding and buying inventory, and getting customers to come to their store. They perserved through it all and now run
	   two stores in different cities while also running an online website where customers can buy games. They continue to live their dream as they help customers
	   to find their treasure every day.</p>
